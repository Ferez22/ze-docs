# Cloudflare

This guide explains how to set up Cloudflare Tunnels and connect them to your own domain, including domain configuration, Docker setup, and connecting running services.

#### 🔗 Step 1 — Connect Your Domain to Cloudflare

1. Create a Cloudflare Account
   Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com and create an account if you don’t already have one.
2. Add Your Domain
   • In the dashboard, click Add a Site.
   • Enter your domain name (e.g. myapp.com) and choose the Free plan (or higher if needed).
   • Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records automatically.
3. Update Nameservers
   • Cloudflare will provide you with two nameservers (e.g. amy.ns.cloudflare.com and john.ns.cloudflare.com).
   • Log in to your domain registrar (e.g. Google Domains, Namecheap, GoDaddy).
   • Replace the existing nameservers with the ones provided by Cloudflare.
   • Wait for propagation (usually takes 5–30 minutes).
4. Verify Domain Connection
   • Once propagated, your domain will show as Active in the Cloudflare dashboard.

#### 🐳 Step 2 — Create a Cloudflare Tunnel with Docker

Cloudflare Tunnels let you securely connect your local or containerized services to the internet without exposing public IPs or opening ports.

- Generate a Tunnel Token
  1.  Go to Zero Trust Dashboard → https://one.dash.cloudflare.com
  2.  Navigate to Access → Tunnels
  3.  Click Create a Tunnel
  4.  Give it a name (e.g. myapp-tunnel)
  5.  Copy the generated Tunnel Token — you’ll need it in the next step

#### ⚙️ Step 3 — Configure the Tunnel to Point to Your Service

##### Using config.yml

For more control, you can use a configuration file. Create a directory, e.g. cloudflare-config, and inside it add a config.yml file:

```js filename="config.yml"
tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
credentials-file: /home/nonroot/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: api.myapp.com
    service: http://host.docker.internal:8080
  - hostname: frontend.myapp.com
    service: http://host.docker.internal:5173
  - service: http_status:404
```
