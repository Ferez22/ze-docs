# Database

This project is setup to use PostgreSQL. But you can also self host supabase.

### PostgreSQL

#### Docker

you can connect to your postgreSQL and run SQL queries directly. Use this: `docker exec -it mycro-services-boilerplate-postgres-db-1 psql -U postgresadmin`. It is recommended that you use variables for the user and password, and obviously chose a stronger password.

### Supabase

Follow the [official documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#before-you-begin) of supabase on how to self host
