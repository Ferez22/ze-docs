## Getting started

This frontend is created using nextJs. Notice the Dockerfile at the root folder. It is a multi stage Dockerfile that build a dev and a prod version of the app.
You can of course start the frontend directly with `npm run dev`or `yarn dev`

- **import** this `global-config.ts`ile is the backbone of your frontend app. You setup here all the important things like routes, stripe config, auth config etc .. It iis still and always under construciton and maintenance. It must be typesecure so create/edit the ConfigType

#### Dev

##### way 1

- First, build your docker image:
  `docker build --target production -t ze-frontend-dev .`
- Then run the container
  `docker run -p 3000:3000 ze-frontend-dev`

##### way 2 (RECOMMENDED)

- Run `docker compose up --build`outside the frontend folder, this way frontend and backend are up and when you make changes, they both automatically refresh

#### Production

- First, build your production docker image:
  `docker build --target production -t ze-frontend-prod .`
- Then run the container
  `docker run -p 3000:3000 ze-frontend-prod`

### Frontend Tools

- As a Component library we have schad/cn and magic UI.

### Frontend Logic

The frontend is connected to the backend. There is a players hook that takes care of all logic of getting players, creating a new player and deleting a player. This is following a Best practice way of handling such cases.
